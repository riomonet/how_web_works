## **Part One: Solidify Terminology**

In your own terms, define the following terms:

- What is HTTP?
  Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is a communication protocol used by web browser clients
  to commuicate with Web servers.
  clients initiate requests and servers reply with responses.

  
  
- What is a URL?
  Uniform resource locator
  consissts of
  Protocol / Domain name / port / target resource / query string

- What is DNS?
  Domain name service is a ip address lookup tool for
  translating names to ip addresses
  
- What is a query string?
  it is a the string at the end of the url starting with a ?
  that is passed for client to server in a HTTP handshake
  
- What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
  Get and Post,
  Get initiates a request to get inforamtion from the server.
  Post initates a request to change some state of the server and/or its other resources ie Database.


- What is an HTTP request?
  Web Clients such as Brave initiate http requests.

- What is an HTTP response?
  Web servers provide responses.
  
- What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
  HTTP header is a list of key value pairs separated by a colon that allows the client and server to
  send additiona meta data back and forth in request in response.
  some examples would be

  Accept: json,text/html
  Connections: keep-alive
  User-agent: brave
  
- What are the processes that happen when you type “[http://somesite.com/some/page.html](http://somesite.com/some/page.html)” into a browser?
  http: lets the client know you are using http protocol.
  somesite.com is translated into an ip address, the name to ip may happen in local cached, or in your router, at  your service provider, or from a dns server.
  once the ip is found a http get request is sent to the web server at ip address on port 80 requesting some/page.html  wbe server will reply
  with that page.
  


## ****Part Two: Practice Tools****

1. Using ***curl***, make a ***GET*** request to the  *icanhazdadjoke.com* API to find all jokes involving the word “picurl -H "Accept: text/plain"
 curl -H "Accept: text/plain" "https://icanhazdadjoke.com/search?term=pirate"

   
2. Use ***dig*** to find what the IP address is for *icanhazdadjoke.com*

   172.67.198.173
   104.21.66.15
   
3. Make a simple web page and serve it using ***python3 -m http.server***. Visit the page in a browser.



## **Part Three: Explore Dev Tools**

Build a very simple HTML form that uses the GET method (it can use the same page URL for the action) when the form is submitted.

Add a field or two to the form and, after submitting it, explore in Chrome Developer tools how you can view the request and response headers.
 post method not supported error code status 501 post unsupproted

Edit the page to change the form type to POST, refresh in the browser and re-submit. Do you still see the field in the query string? Explore in Chrome how you can view the request and response headers, as well as the form data.



## **Part Four: Explore the URL API**

At times, it’s useful for your JavaScript to look at the URL of the browser window and change how the script works depending on parts of that (particularly the query string).

[Read about the URL API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL)

Try some of the code examples in the Chrome Console so that you can get comfortable with the basic methods and properties for instances of the URL class.
